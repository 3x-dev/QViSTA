# QViSTA: A Novel Quantum Vision Transformer for Multi-Stage Early Alzheimer’s Diagnosis using Optimized Variational Quantum Circuits
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used technique among neurologists for detecting brain abnormalities such as strokes, tumors, and various forms of dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease. However, accurately diagnosing different stages of Alzheimer’s remains challenging, with nearly 1 in 5 patients misdiagnosed due to symptom overlap with other conditions. This paper introduces QViSTA, a novel hybrid quantum vision transformer (QViT) model that leverages quantum parallelism to enhance the early diagnosis and differentiation of Alzheimer’s disease stages. By integrating quantum variational circuits (VQCs) with vision transformers (ViTs), QViSTA addresses the limitations of classical machine learning models regarding data scalability and computational efficiency. Utilizing a balanced, multiclass dataset of 40,000 MRI images, QViSTA achieved a validation area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) score of 87.86% and a test AUC of 86.67%, closely matching the performance of a benchmarked classical ViT while reducing the feature space by 3.18%. Early and accurate detection of Alzheimer’s is crucial, as it allows for timely interventions that can significantly improve the quality of life for patients and their caregivers. As more hospitals adopt AI for biomedical imaging, QViSTA’s innovative approach could dramatically reduce misdiagnosis rates, improve patient outcomes, and cut costs.
